    summary: "Sony is drip-feeding information about its next PSVR headset. The company today revealed details about the new virtual reality controllers it will be using with the PlayStation 5",
    paragraphs: [
        `Hideaki Nishino, senior vice president at PlayStation, wrote that the new "orb" style shape will be just as innovative as DualSense. The design somewhat resembles what we've already seen from Oculus.`,
        
        `Each controller has the adaptive triggers you find in the DualSense PS5 controller, as well as new haptic feedback and finger detection. The headset will track the controllers with a ring on the bottom of the controllers.`,

        `These controllers will finally put to rest the PlayStation Move controller, which debuted in 2010 with the PlayStation 3 for motion controlled games. While the Nintendo Wii made motion controllers popular, the Movo continued on as Sony's VR controllers with PSVR, which used their glowing orbs for tracking.`,

        `We've yet to see the next PlayStation VR headset, which could become one the best VR headsets for gamers, but Sony says the controllers should be in the hands of developers soon.`

    title: "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow",
    bigImage: 'assets/images/gaming-article-hero-background.jpg',
    summary: "Lords of Shadow introduces us to Gabriel Belmont, a member of a holy order of knights called the Brotherhood of Light. These guys are like the Jedi of Castlevania, protecting the normals from everything that wants to kill and eat them. Gabriel wants to save the world from the Dark Lords, but he also has a more personal stake in the mission: he is out for revenge for the death of his childhood sweetheart.",
    paragraphs: [
        "Gabriel Belmont will have his revenge upon the Lords of Shadow, venturing to the very depths of hell to find retribution against those who have corrupted the ideals of the Brotherhood of Light and murdered his wife.",

        },

        "While this Belmont's fight against the forces of evil may sound somehow familiar, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow bears little resemblance to the other games in the 24-year-old series. Developer Mercury Steam's take on the Castlevania franchise, famous for its whips and vampire slaying, uses a different approach. Call it a reboot, if you want, because Lords of Shadow looks more like a Ninja Gaiden or God of War action game, full of violent battles and gruesome boss monsters that require great dexterity, patience and skill to defeat. Expect vampires aplenty, just don't count on Lord Dracula himself showing up for the zillionth time.",

        "Metroidvania this is not. Instead of exploring one large castle you proceed linearly from level to level (although you are encouraged to backtrack to previously unreachable areas once you've upgraded your skills). There is no map and very little in the way of exploration.",

        "Items to find are scarce -- much less than in a typical Castlevania. Instead, Lords of Shadow is about action and combat. There are dozens of combos to unlock and the game is constantly funneling you towards your next encounter with a gang of monsters. All of the button mashing made my eyes glaze over after a while and I felt like I was just going through the motions. There are also many aggravating sections where you're trying to solve a puzzle (many of which are clever) and enemies keep endlessly respawning around you. I found the quiet moments in between skirmishes more interesting and satisfying."]

    paragraphs: [
        `While the trailer is very similar to the one shown during the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade reveal, we get to see more of the improved visuals directly compared to the PS4 version. Also showcased are such additions as better textures and lighting, fog effects, photo mode, faster load times, and more. Check out the video below!`,

    title: "Need a GeForce RTX 3000 GPU? GameStop Can Hook You Up",
    bigImage: 'assets/images/gtx3000.jpg',
    summary: `As reported by PCMag, GameStop has undertaken a new business venture. The renowned video game retailer has started selling computer hardware on its online store, including Nvidia's elusive GeForce RTX 3000 (Ampere) offerings that are among the best graphics cards that money can buy -- or rather cannot buy.`,
    paragraphs: [
        `When a company has spent a lifetime doing the same thing, it's difficult for it to leave its comfort zone. In fact, many companies end up going out of business if they don't get with the times. It's commendable that GameStop is taking a crack at being a computer hardware retailer, especially in these difficult times. With this new endeavor, GameStop will be joining the ranks of seasoned veterans, such as Newegg, Micro Center, Best Buy and Amazon - just to name some.`,

        `GameStop won't just stop at selling computer hardware either. In its Q4 2020 earnings call, CEO George Sherman reaffirmed the company's commitment to expand its catalog of products to cover a wide variety of other gaming-oriented products, including laptops, routers and monitors.`,

        `"We are continuing the work to expand our addressable market by growing GameStop's product catalog. This includes growing our product offerings across PC gaming, computers, monitors, game tables, mobile gaming and gaming TVs, to name only a few. These categories represent natural extensions that our customers would expect to buy from us, expanding our addressable market size by over five times, and over time, will reduce our reliance on the cyclicality of the console-based gaming market."`
