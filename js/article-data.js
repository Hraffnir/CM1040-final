    title: "Castlevania: Lords of Shadow",

    summary: "Lords of Shadow introduces us to Gabriel Belmont, a member of a holy order of knights called the Brotherhood of Light. These guys are like the Jedi of Castlevania, protecting the normals from everything that wants to kill and eat them. Gabriel wants to save the world from the Dark Lords, but he also has a more personal stake in the mission: he is out for revenge for the death of his childhood sweetheart.",
    paragraphs: ["Gabriel Belmont will have his revenge upon the Lords of Shadow, venturing to the very depths of hell to find retribution against those who have corrupted the ideals of the Brotherhood of Light and murdered his wife.",
        "While this Belmont's fight against the forces of evil may sound somehow familiar, Castlevania: Lords of Shadow bears little resemblance to the other games in the 24-year-old series. Developer Mercury Steam's take on the Castlevania franchise, famous for its whips and vampire slaying, uses a different approach. Call it a reboot, if you want, because Lords of Shadow looks more like a Ninja Gaiden or God of War action game, full of violent battles and gruesome boss monsters that require great dexterity, patience and skill to defeat. Expect vampires aplenty, just don't count on Lord Dracula himself showing up for the zillionth time.",
        "Metroidvania this is not. Instead of exploring one large castle you proceed linearly from level to level (although you are encouraged to backtrack to previously unreachable areas once you've upgraded your skills). There is no map and very little in the way of exploration.",
        "Items to find are scarce -- much less than in a typical Castlevania. Instead, Lords of Shadow is about action and combat. There are dozens of combos to unlock and the game is constantly funneling you towards your next encounter with a gang of monsters. All of the button mashing made my eyes glaze over after a while and I felt like I was just going through the motions. There are also many aggravating sections where you're trying to solve a puzzle (many of which are clever) and enemies keep endlessly respawning around you. I found the quiet moments in between skirmishes more interesting and satisfying."]
