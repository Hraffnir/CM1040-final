<h3>Final Project Report</h3>

<h4>Story behind the website</h4>
Having grown up surrounded by the technological boom of the internet, computers, gaming and powerful mobile devices, I've chosen to explore gaming and gaming technology related topics.

The structure of the website is designed for easy and fast consumption of content.

<h4>Inspiration</h4>
I looked at The Verge, IGN and similar gaming and technology oriented websites. I prefer cleaner and minimalist aesthetics, with focus on the content. 

<h4>Site Accessibility</h4>
My site is accessible by allowing users to navigate around using the keyboard, notably using tab to iterate through website controls, or by using the arrows and enter keys to select an article to read.

Furthermore, dark mode support was added, changing the colours of the background, text and shadows, to prevent
eye strain and remain aesthetically pleasing.

<h4>Useability</h4>
Useability is considered here in terms of clarity in the website. It's very clear where buttons are located, what they represent and do, where navigation links are, what page you're currently on by noticeably changing colours and responsiveness ensures the layout remains optimal for the user's viewport.

<h4>Learning/Discovering</h4>
MDN Web Docs, CSS Tricks, StackOverflow and w3schools were generally all I needed to succeed with what I needed to implement. This was largely all I needed to get by, specifically for CSS animations which is used for the hamburger menu icon, the event handler for window resizing to trigger a function that will ensure certain images are always positioned and sized correctly and lastly for learning flexbox.

<h4>What aspects worked well?</h4>
I think the colour scheme, responsiveness and general simplicity/clarity of the website worked quite well. There aren't any frills, it's functional, straightforward and delivers the content in a minimalist package.

<h4>What aspects could be improved/be done differently?</h4>
Although I like the minimalist look, I think it could be filled out <i>a little</i> more, a bit more body/content essentially.

Aside from the look and feel, the javascript could be better organized and made to be more reusable.

<h4>Resources used to create website</h4>
No libraries/plugins were used to create the website, it was all done from scratch and driven by inspiration from other websites mentioned above.
